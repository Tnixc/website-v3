      <p class="text-xl py-4 text-rp-subtle ">I'm a <span class="font-bold text-rp-text">15 year old high school student from Hong Kong living in Canada</span>. I enjoy video games, coding, reading books and webcomics, watching anime, listening to lots of jpop, touhou songs, vocaloids and all that, and doing 2D and 3D art. I started webdev around 2022, but honestly time has been blur since 2020 so I'm not sure.
        I also like trains and bikes(a huge fan of dutch urban design), public transit, typography, and open source. I also like chilling in IKEA and hiking :3</p>
